<h1>ABOUT THE ST. JOHNS COUNTY CAREER ACADEMIES</h1>
<h2>Why should you join a Career Academy?</h2>
<p>The most important reason to join is students become part of a group who share their interests and desire to learn about a specific career field. Students will be taught by teachers with expertise in the career field and excitement to engage learning. </p>
<p>Joining a Career Academy can also provide opportunities that may not be available to other high school students. Students may earn more college credits or earn industry certifications through their enrollment, as well as become more involved in local businesses. Students participating in a Career Academy have a clear path for graduation. Each academy meets all graduation requirements and prepares students for postsecondary education and/or the world of work. While in the academy, students have an opportunity to participate in special activities and events that provide greater awareness of the specific career area and opportunities within that area. Academy participants will be part of a small group of students with similar interests completing courses together. An advisor and business mentor will be provided to answer questions and help each student as they complete their high school experience. Many programs offer industry certification exams.  Those passed are listed on the high school transcript and may count as college credits depending on the college/university the student attends and the major the student pursues. </p>
<h2>Who is eligible to join a Career Academy?</h2>
<p>The St. Johns County school district’s career and technical programs are open to all eligible high school students in the district. We are committed to a policy of nondiscrimination in employment and educational opportunity. No person shall be discriminated against or harassed in any educational program, services or activities, or employment conditions or practices on the basis of race, color, national origin, religion, sex, age, disability, marital status, or sexual orientation. </p>
<p>Lack of English language skills will not be a barrier to admission and participation. The district may assess each student’s ability to benefit from specific programs through placement tests and counseling, and if necessary, will provide services or referrals to better prepare students for successful participation. </p>
<p>If you have questions, complaints, or requests for additional information regarding discrimination or harassment, please email <strong>academies@stjohns.k12.fl.us</strong> or call <strong>(904) 547-4870.</strong></p>
