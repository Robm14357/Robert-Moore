<h1>ST. JOHNS COUNTY CAREER ACADEMIES</h1>
<p>A <strong>Career Academy</strong> is a sequence of specific elective courses designed around a career theme. career
Academies create a “school within a school” feel since students select to be grouped by a common area
of interest. Each Career Academy has a <strong>Program of Study</strong> that helps guide students in course selection
and plan for postsecondary experiences. The Career Academy course is one of their elective courses that
they will take each year they stay in the academy. Students still take all of their academic courses
required for graduation at the same school</p>
